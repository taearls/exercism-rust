# Exercism Rust

This repository tracks my solutions for the [Rust track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust) on Exercism's learning platform.

Including solutions all 121 exercises here would get verbose quickly. However, I will point out some of my favorites.

Overall, I have really enjoyed learning Rust via Exercism. After reading the Rust book, I found myself wanting to put it into practice, but I was overwhelmed by the large domain of problems Rust is able to solve. Do I make a web app (yes, as it turns out), a microservice, a video game, etc? So many possibilities. Exercism guided my learning and helped me feel comfortable using the standard library and popular Rust crates to implement idiomatic solutions.
