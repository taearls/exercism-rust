# Exercism Rust

This repository is a monorepo tracking all my solutions for the [Rust track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust) on Exercism's learning platform in a centralized location. If you're interested, check out my [Exercism profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/taearls)!

Including solutions for all the 100+ exercises here would quickly get unwieldy. However, I will point out some of my favorites, including links to the Exercism prompt, my solution, and a brief explanation of what I learned.

Overall, I have really enjoyed learning Rust via Exercism. After reading the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book), I found myself wanting to put it into practice, but I was overwhelmed by the large domain of problems Rust is able to solve. Do I make a web app ([yes](https://www.github.com/taearls/portfolio), as it turns out!), a microservice, a video game, etc? So many possibilities. Exercism guided my learning and helped me feel comfortable using the standard library and popular Rust crates to implement idiomatic solutions.  

## My Favorite Solutions (sorted alphabetically)

### Table

| Name | Exercism Link | Link to my solution | What I learned |
|------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Affine Cipher | [Exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/affine-cipher) | [Solution](./affine-cipher) | I learned about the [apphine cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher) algorithm, which is a rudimentary way of encoding a message by substituting alphabetic letters. |
| Atbash Cipher | [Exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/atbash-cipher) | [Solution](./atbash-cipher) | I learned about the [atbash cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash_cipher) algorithm, which is a rudimentary way of encoding a message by using the alphabet in reverse order. |
| Binary Search | [Exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/binary-search) | [Solution](./binary-search) | I wrote a basic implementation of the [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) algorithm. I liked how Rust's standard library enabled me to write a clean, functional solution with zero cost abstractions. Solutions like this became good exercises for my foray into studying functional programming patterns. |
| Crypto Square | [Exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/crypto-square) | [Solution](./crypto-square) | I liked this one because it was an interesting method of encoding and decoding a plain text message by slicing it into rows that make up a square, and then traversing that square. This helped me solidify working with vectors in Rust. |
| Dot DSL | [Exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/dot-dsl) | [Solution](./dot-dsl) | I liked this one because it gave me a simple use case for a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to implement. This exercise was my first applied experience working with modules in Rust and learning how to publically expose structs and functions so that other files (e.g., unit tests), can use them. |
| Largest Series Product | [Exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/largest-series-product) | [Solution](./largest-series-product) | As a former high school mathlete, I love implementing number theory in code. This one was interesting because it required me to process individual digits within a given number. |
| Luhn | [Exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/luhn) | [Solution](./luhn) |  |
| PaaS IO | [Exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/paasio) | [Solution](./paasio) |  |
| Palindrome Products | [Exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/palindrome-products) | [Solution](./palindrome-products) |  |
| Spiral Matrix | [Exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/spiral-matrix) | [Solution](./spiral-matrix) |  |
| Two Bucket | [Exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/two-bucket) | [Solution](./two-bucket) |  |
| Variable Length Quantity | [Exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/variable-length-quantity) | [Solution](./variable-length-quantity) |  |
